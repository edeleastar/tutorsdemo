MyRent02

We review the structure, model and code in the MyRent 01 and 02 applications. The application at this stage has 2 views - sometimes called a 'Master-Detail' pattern. The Master presents a list of items which, if selected, will launch a detail view presenting the individual items. The List if items is randomly generated at application startup, and cannot be extended.
